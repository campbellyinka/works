                <h2 class="tracking-in-expand">About me.</h2>
                <p>I started my design journey from elementary school getting myself into trouble for drawing on every available spaces around me  including table-tops and walls (my favourite) .  My passion for art and design propelled me into obtaining a bachelors degree in Graphic Design back in 2005  where  I mastered the principles of design with regards to layout and visual design.</p>

                <p>The emergence of web and user experience design changed the trajectory of my career which led to my exploring the possibilities of solving problems with design  and crafting amazing user experiences. This passion for solving problems  propelled me into relocating to London where I bagged a Master of Arts in Web Design & Content Planning from the University of Greenwich in 2022.</p>
                    
                <p>I am passionate about helping people understand how to use technology to make their lives better. As a designer, I see myself as an advocate, helping people understand that thoughtful designs have the power to change the world.</p>
                    
                <p>Adept in HTML, CSS,  JavaScript, Adobe Creative Suite and Figma, my proficiency extends beyond mere code. My extensive training, including certifications in Google UX Design and Responsive Web Design, showcases a commitment to staying at the forefront of industry trends. I am currently learning Front-End and Back-End technologies which include REACT, REDUX, PHP, Express JS, PostgreSQL, PYTHON, DevOps and more in a Fullstack Developer Traineeship Program.</p>
                    
                <p>When I am not designing, I love to explore new places and taking photographs. I listen to Afro-pop music and play Pro Evolution Soccer.</p>

                <p>I am currently looking for a role as a Front-End Developer or UI/UX Designer.</p>
